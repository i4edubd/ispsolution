   - Cache operator statistics
   - **Impact:** Page load time -30%

2. **Date Formatting** (3 days)
   - Display "21st of each month"
   - Show "1st, 2nd, 3rd" with proper suffixes
   - **Impact:** Better UX

3. **Customer Overall Status** (2 days)

## 🚫 DO NOT Implement

These features are NOT worth the effort:

1. ❌ **Node/Central Database Split**
   - Reason: Adds massive complexity
   - Benefit: None for 99% of ISPs

2. ❌ **Per-Operator RADIUS Database**
   - Reason: Single DB works fine
   - Benefit: Minimal for most cases

3. ❌ **Simplify RADIUS Implementation**
   - Reason: Our implementation is better
   - Benefit: Would be a downgrade

4. ❌ **Remove Payment Gateways**
   - Reason: Multi-gateway is superior
   - Benefit: None (would lose features)
