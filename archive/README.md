## Archived Summary Files

These summary documents tracked historical progress and have been consolidated:

### Feature Implementation Summaries

- Feature linking documentation

### Progress Reports
- Individual task completion reports
- Feature-by-feature implementation summaries

## Why These Were Archived

1. **Consolidation** - Multiple TODO files created confusion. Single source of truth now in PROJECT_STATUS.md
2. **100% Complete** - All tasks completed, no active TODOs remain
3. **Historical Value** - Preserved for reference and project history
4. **Clarity** - New documentation structure is clearer and easier to navigate
