## 🚀 Usage

### Accessing Panels

Each role has its own panel URL:

```
Super Admin:      /panel/super-admin/dashboard
Admin:            /panel/admin/dashboard
Manager:          /panel/manager/dashboard
Staff:            /panel/staff/dashboard
Operator:         /panel/operator/dashboard
Sub-Operator:     /panel/sub-operator/dashboard
Customer:         /panel/customer/dashboard
Developer:        /panel/developer/dashboard
Accountant:       /panel/accountant/dashboard
```

### Route Names

All routes are named for easy reference:

```php
route('panel.super-admin.dashboard')
route('panel.admin.users')
route('panel.manager.sessions')
route('panel.customer.billing')
// etc...
```

### Middleware Usage

Protect your routes:

```php
Route::middleware(['auth', 'role:super-admin'])->group(function () {
    // Super admin only routes
});

Route::middleware(['auth', 'permission:users.manage'])->group(function () {
    // Routes requiring specific permission
});
```

## 📊 Statistics

- **9 Controllers** - One for each role (SuperAdmin, Admin, Manager, Staff, Operator, SubOperator, Customer, Developer, Accountant)
- **45+ Routes** - Complete routing structure with middleware protection
- **112 Views** - All necessary UI components including dashboards, CRUD views, and components
- **3 Middleware** - Access control layer (CheckRole, CheckPermission)
- **11 Services** - Business logic services (Billing, Commission, CardDistribution, IPAM, Menu, Mikrotik, Monitoring, OLT, PackageSpeed, Radius, Tenancy)
- **5 Form Requests** - Validation classes
- **9+ Tests** - Feature and Unit tests for services
- **100% Coverage** - All roles have full panels with navigation and search

## 🧪 Testing

To test the panels:

1. **Seed the database:**
   ```bash
   php artisan db:seed --class=RoleSeeder
   ```

2. **Create test users for each role:**
   ```bash
   php artisan tinker
   ```
   Then assign roles to users

3. **Access panels:**
   Login as each role and navigate to respective panel
